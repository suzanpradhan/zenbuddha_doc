# FormCard Component

The `FormCard` component is a reusable form wrapper that provides a styled container for form elements. It simplifies form creation by handling the `onSubmit` event and allowing you to pass custom content as children.

## Usage

To use the `FormCard` component, import it and wrap your form elements inside it. You can optionally pass an `onSubmit` handler and additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

### Example

```jsx
import { FormCard } from "react-to-ui";
import "react-to-ui/dist/index.css";

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
     <FormCard >
          ........
    </FormCard>  
  );
};
