# FormGroup Component

The `FormGroup` component is designed to group form elements, often pairing a label or title with its corresponding input field or set of fields. This component provides a consistent layout and styling for forms, making it easier to maintain a uniform design throughout your application.

## Usage

To use the `FormGroup` component, simply wrap your form elements inside it, optionally providing a `title` prop to act as a label or descriptor for the group.

### Example

```jsx
import { FormGroup } from "react-to-ui";
import { FormCard } from "react-to-ui";
import "react-to-ui/dist/index.css"

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
     <FormCard >
      <FormGroup>
         ........
      </FormGroup>
    </FormCard>  
  );
};
